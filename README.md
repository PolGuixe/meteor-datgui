# Dat.Gui - A Javascript controller library, repackaged for Meteor.

This is a simple Meteor package for including dat.gui.js which is a lightweight controller library.

For more information please visit:

[Meteor](http://meteor.com)

## How to install 
Like any other Meteor package you can simply run the following from the command line: 

`meteor add polguixe:meteor-datgui`

## Notes
I'll try to keep this package up to date with each dat.gui release. I'm pretty busy though, so feel free to either message me or update the library yourself if I miss a release.
